  # --pid: create a pid namespace to hide external processes in top/ps

  # --user: create a user namespace
  # --map-root-user: may want to change this for security later, but this is
  #     close to what we accomplish with the old chroot-only approach

#
#    --user="$ns/user" --map-root-user \
#
# Revisit on 22.04, where unshare should support additional options:
# --map-current-user/--map-user: Might make it easier to run unpriv w/o runuser
# --(ch)root might play nicer w/ --mount-proc
# --setgid might let us call runuser inside the container
# Don't forget to update cc-exec to use the same namespaces.
#
# Ideally, I'd like to have root in the container by default, be able to
# write to the filesystem, be able to runuser in the container or have a
# flag to drop root, and not be able to do things that require root outside
# the container like configure network, mount devices, etc.
